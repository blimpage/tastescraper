# Tastescraper

This is intended to be a little Ruby script that you can run locally that'll find albums on Bandcamp that you might like, based on the collections of people who own the same albums as you.

That's the idea, anyway. It's currently a big procedural mess that only does about half of that. Please don't judge me
